BACKGROUND
:
Ischemic
heart
disease
is
the
primary
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
among
diabetics
,
especially
those
who
became
ill
at
a
young
age
.

More
importantly
,
this
fusion
converted
a
less
effective
vaccine
into
one
with
significant
potency
against
established
E7
-
expressing
metastatic
tumors
.

Reverse
transcription
-
PCR
analysis
of
mRNA
from
patients
shows
that
each
of
these
five
mutations
results
in
aberrant
splicing
.

Using
the
postural
and
force
data
as
input
to
a
3
-
D
biomechanical
model
,
the
lumbosacral
spinal
compression
was
calculated
.

Sequence
analysis
revealed
significant
differences
between
the
5
'
region
of
the
beta
subunit
gene
and
the
corresponding
regions
of
the
homologous
GlyR
alpha
subunit
genes
;
it
also
identified
a
novel
exon
(
exon
0
)
that
encodes
most
of
the
5
'-
untranslated
portion
of
the
GlyR
beta
mRNA
.
